1. statics vs method for mongoose - 
Use method on individual documents if you want to manipulate the individual  document like adding tokens etc. 
Use the statics approach if you want query the whole collection.

2. deploying to heroku - 
heroku login
heroku create
set port number to process.env.PORT || 5000
create engine object in package.json and set node and npm versions in engine object
set config var in herkou dashboard
